# AUTOSAR

### Sprints AUTOSAR Masterclass Project Data

Used Sprints AUTOSAR Authoring Tool (SAAT) to implement a seat control application that controls the height, incline, and slide of a seat. The seat has 2 modes, automatic and manual. The automatic mode uses the passenger's weight measured by a weight sensor and other sensors to calculate the optimal positions by actuating 3 different motors, each for the variable being changed. The project has a sender-receiver interface, a client-server interface, and a mode switch interface in the RTE environment.
